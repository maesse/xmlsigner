# 🇲🇾 Malaysian e-Invoicing XML Signer & Verifier

This is a personal project to explore, verify, and sign digital signatures used in Malaysia’s e-Invoicing system, as described in publicly available documentation from LHDN (Lembaga Hasil Dalam Negeri Malaysia).

## 🧩 What This Does

- Parses sample e-Invoice XML documents
- Recomputes digest values (e.g. SHA256 hashes) for signed components
- Verifies integrity against the expected values provided in the XML
- Signs documents using the Malaysian e-Invoice XML signature flow
- Helps understand how Malaysia's digital signing scheme works (from a technical perspective)

## 📁 Project Structure & Implementation Notes

- **java/**: Main implementation for parsing, verifying, and signing e-Invoice XMLs. Most complete and accurate.
- **python/**: Incomplete; does not calculate the xades:SignedProperties digest correctly. Contains quite a few notes about the signature process.
- **csharp/**: Only calculates the xades:SignedProperties digest for reference/testing.
- The python and C# code was part of the exploration phase. The java code combines all the learnings into a working implementation.

## 📚 Resources Used

- Official LHDN documentation ([Main signature page](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/signature/), [signature samples](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/sample/), [signature creation details](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/signature-creation/))
- XML Signature (XMLDSIG) specification

## ⚡ Quirks & Surprises

- Canonicalization and whitespace handling are critical -— minor differences break signature validation.
- The order of XML elements and attributes must match exactly as in the sample signatures. (Unverified how strict the API with this)
- Digest calculation for xades:SignedProperties is especially sensitive as it doesn't follow normal canonicalization procedures, instead relying on internal Microsoft XML serialization implementation.
- The way the LHDN made the implementation means that essentially no existing tool will correctly validate a signed XML nor will it be able to create a validly signed XML.
- The signature is calculated not on the full SignedInfo tag data but only on the hash of the document (excluding signature tags), meaning that the SignedProperties could potentially be changed while allowing for the document to still be validated.
- The MS XML handling was not at all obvious, but the use of Powershell and .net libraries in the [JSON documentation](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/files/Digital_Signature_User_Guide.pdf) gave a clue.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x for generating document digest and verifying signature
- C# for generating xades:SignedProperties digest
- Java (1.8 compatible) for full signing and verification implementation

## ☕ Java (Signing & Verifying)

The Java implementation is inside `java/xmlsignature`. There is no single entrypoint; instead, two files have `main` methods:

- `com.example.ValidateDocument` — for verifying signed XML documents
- `com.example.SignDocument` — for signing a single document

To run either, use Maven from the `java/xmlsignature` directory. For example:

```bash
cd java/xmlsignature
# To run the verifier:
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.ValidateDocument"

# To run the signer:
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.SignDocument"
```

You may need to adjust file paths or arguments as needed for your environment.
